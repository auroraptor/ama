Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Music. Teaching. Memes. Whatever.

## Guidelines

* Ensure your question has not already been answered.
* Use a succinct title and description.
* Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
* Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow and maths questions on Math Exchange.
* Be nice, civil and polite (as always).
* If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback might come faster 🌟
